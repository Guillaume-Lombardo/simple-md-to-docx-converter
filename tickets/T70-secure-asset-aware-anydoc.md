# T70 - Implement secure asset-aware anydoc conversion

## Objective

Implement the approved local anydoc adapter and deterministic asset-aware Markdown package builder
for reverse conversion.

## Acceptance criteria

* Add the exact approved `firecrawl-anydoc` dependency through `uv`, preserve Python 3.14 and UBI 9
  compatibility, and include it in dependency, SBOM, license, vulnerability, and release
  verification.
* Parse only the format matrix approved by T69 from bounded in-memory or isolated-workspace inputs
  after the existing malware-scanning boundary.
* Convert structured content into deterministic UTF-8 GitHub-Flavored Markdown while preserving
  supported headings, lists, tables, links, notes, code, equations, and document order.
* Emit a deterministic ZIP containing one root Markdown file plus referenced files under `assets/`;
  every exported image has a safe relative `![]()` link at the corresponding source position, a
  normalized allowed media type and extension, bounded bytes/dimensions/count, collision-free
  stable name, and no orphan or escaping archive path.
* Reject or safely degrade unavailable images and document-controlled remote images according to
  the T69 contract; never download remote resources.
* Keep OCR and every hosted Firecrawl path disabled. Scanned or image-only PDF input fails with a
  stable `needs_ocr`-style error and no network request.
* Map anydoc and packaging failures to stable content-free Markweave errors without filenames,
  document content, secrets, or local paths.
* Add unit, corpus/golden, fuzz-or-mutation, security, and real-library integration coverage for
  success and relevant malformed, encrypted, decompression, nesting, asset, timeout, cancellation,
  and resource-limit failures.

## Dependencies

* T08
* T18
* T20
* T69

## Implementation boundary

* Own the anydoc adapter, asset-aware serializer/package builder, reverse-conversion domain errors,
  format corpus, dependency lock, and directly affected backend-image contents.
* Do not add HTTP routes, persistent jobs, database migrations, or browser UI.
* Do not implement OCR or any network-backed fallback.

## Quality requirements

* Preserve arbitrary-UID, read-only-root, bounded-workspace, no-document-egress, and malware-
  scanning invariants.
* Maintain the repository coverage thresholds and add a dedicated real-anydoc integration marker
  or domain if required by T69.
* Keep repository artifacts and user-facing errors in English.

## Progress

* 2026-09-03: Created from the approved feasibility decomposition; blocked by T69.
