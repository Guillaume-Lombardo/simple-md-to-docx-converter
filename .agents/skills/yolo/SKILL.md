description: Publish the current Codex work in a GitHub pull request, squash-merge it, then clean up its local and remote branches. Use only when the user explicitly invokes `$yolo` or requests the full publish, merge, and cleanup sequence.

# Publish, merge, and clean up

Run each phase in order from the repository root. The implicit pull request is the one for the current Codex work and current branch.

## Authorization granted by invocation

An explicit `$yolo` invocation grants, in the same request, the approvals required to:

- push the exact current work branch;
- create, update, and mark ready the pull request for that branch and the captured target branch;
- squash-merge that pull request at the exact captured head SHA after all required checks, reviews,
  conversations, and protections pass; and
- delete the exact captured source branch locally and remotely after the merge is verified.

Do not stop to request those approvals again. The authorization is scoped to the current work,
source branch, target branch, and pull request captured during this invocation. It expires if the
head SHA changes unexpectedly, new work appears, the target or pull request is ambiguous, a check
or review fails, or any phase has an ambiguous external result. It never authorizes a force-push,
protection bypass, unrelated pull request, target-branch deletion, destructive worktree cleanup, or
resolution of a new blocker without the user's direction.

## 1. Publish

1. Read all repository instructions and the product specification referenced by `AGENTS.md`.
2. Load and follow `$yeet-github` in full to inspect, validate, commit, push, and open a draft pull
   request. The explicit `$yolo` invocation satisfies `$yeet-github`'s approval requirement for the
   captured push and pull-request publication; do not ask for it again.
3. Retain the exact source and target branches, pushed SHA, pull-request number, and URL.
4. Stop after any failure or ambiguous external result. Never merge or clean up after a partial failure.

## 2. Merge

1. Explicit `$yolo` invocation authorizes merging only the pull request for the current work at the
   captured head SHA. It never authorizes bypassing protections or merging another pull request.
2. Verify with `gh pr view` that the pull request exactly matches the captured source branch and SHA. Reject ambiguity or a changed head.
3. Inspect required checks, reviews, conversations, and protections with `gh pr checks` and `gh pr view --json mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup`.
4. Mark a ready draft with `gh pr ready <number>`.
5. Watch pending checks with `gh pr checks <number> --watch --interval 10`; stop and report any failing check.
6. Present the final state as a progress update, reconfirm that the invocation's authorization is
   still valid, and proceed without requesting a second approval.
7. Use `gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch --match-head-commit <source-sha>`.
8. If GitHub queues the merge, keep monitoring. Clean up only after `gh pr view <number> --json state,mergedAt,mergeCommit` reports `MERGED`.

## 3. Clean up

1. Reconfirm the merged state and capture the merge commit SHA.
2. Refuse cleanup if new tracked, staged, or untracked work appeared after the source commit.
3. Run `git fetch --prune origin`.
4. Switch to the target branch and update it only by fast-forward with `git switch <target-branch>` and `git pull --ff-only origin <target-branch>`.
5. Delete the exact local source branch if it remains. `git branch -D <source-branch>` is allowed only after verified squash merge.
6. If the exact captured unprotected remote source branch remains, delete it under the invocation's
   authorization. Obtain fresh explicit approval only when its exact identity or ownership cannot
   be proven.
7. Run `git status --short --branch` and report the final state.

## Guardrails

- Never use `git clean`, `git reset --hard`, or recursive deletion.
- Never delete the target branch, a protected branch, or a branch whose exact name was not captured before merge.
- Never clean another worktree.
- Never confuse green checks, approval, or mergeability with an actual merge.
- Never extend this authorization to a pull request unrelated to the current work.

## Result

Report the pull-request URL and state, merged SHA, deleted branches, current branch, and final `git status`.
